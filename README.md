# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning algorithms implementation. Custom opencv based environment to test codes. ***Teacher-Student Project will be available here(as an extension to the algorithm implementations), once I compelete it.***
# Implemented Algorithms:
1. Q-Learning
2. DQN using low state dim input
# To Do:
DQN using image as input
DDPG
Actor-Critic
PPO
